These PEM files contain the private keys and associated signer objects for the EXAMPLE CERTIFICATES in ../Dev-Definitions.
As the private keys are present here, it is CRITICALLY IMPORTANT, that those certificates are ONLY USED FOR LOCAL DEVELOPMENT AND TESTING PURPOSES and MUST NEVER BE DEPLOYED TO PRODUCTION!!!
The passphrase for all these test files is "ThisIsATest".
